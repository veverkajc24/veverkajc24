## Hi

MY name is Jack Veverka, and I am a senior Computer Science Engineering student at Ohio State University.

Computer Science and software development have been a passion of mine in middle school, where I first learned the basics of web development. Now, after three years of college, two internships, and developing two startup applications, I am extremely happy with the field and love my work.

Currently I am working with mostly React Native to develop two different mobile apps for iOS. Both use Firebase for user authentication and database storage, which has been a very fun tool to learn how to use!
